Underscore.behaviour
====================

	 /_ _  /_ _    ._     _

This library aims to offer some behaviour pattern in a readable and
easy to use way. It works standalone or as an [Underscore.js][u]
extension.

Currently only a few methods have been implemented. I'll create a
wishlist here. Feel free to fork and add features, I will process
them in matter of 2 days, I swear!
